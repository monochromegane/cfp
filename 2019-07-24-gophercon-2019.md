## Title

Optimization for number of goroutines using feedback control
フィードバック制御を用いたゴルーチン起動数の最適化

## Elevator Pitch

> You have 300 characters to sell your talk. This is known as the "elevator pitch". Make it as exciting and enticing as possible.

The design for number of concurrency is important to achieve both speed and stability.

並行数の設計は，並行処理の速度と安定性を両立させるために重要です．

Giving a good performance without depending on platform and load conditions, it's desirable for the number to be dynamic and rapidly controlled.

プラットフォームや負荷の状態に左右されずに優れたパフォーマンスを得るためには，並行数を動的かつ迅速に制御することが望ましいです．

So, I propose an architecture to solve this by feedback control.

そこで，フィードバック制御によってこれを解決するアーキテクチャを提案します．
